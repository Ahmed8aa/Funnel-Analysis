Optimizing User Experience and Operational Efficiency in Metrocar: A Comprehensive Funnel Analysis Approach
From Data to Decisions: Enhancing Metrocar's Performance through In-depth Funnel Analysis

In my role, I undertook a comprehensive project titled "Optimizing User Experience and Operational Efficiency in Metrocar: A Comprehensive Funnel Analysis Approach." This project aimed to delve deep into Metrocar's operations, uncovering insights to enhance user experience and operational efficiency.

I initiated the project by utilizing advanced SQL queries to establish a robust dataset, meticulously analyzing various aspects of Metrocar's customer funnel. Leveraging Tableau for visualization, I meticulously mapped out each step of the customer funnel, shedding light on user behavior patterns and operational trends.

Furthermore, I conducted in-depth analyses on age distribution across funnel stages and user behavior based on device usage over time, providing valuable insights into demographic preferences and platform usage patterns.

To gain a deeper understanding of Metrocar's operational dynamics, I delved into ride metrics such as acceptance rates, ride requests, and cancellations throughout the year. This analysis extended to exploring ride acceptance and rejection rates by pickup and drop-off locations, providing actionable insights for operational optimization.

During rush hours, I investigated ride requests, acceptance rates, and driver availability, identifying key opportunities for optimizing driver allocation and service provision. Additionally, I explored strategic options such as surge pricing to capitalize on demand patterns and enhance revenue generation.

To gauge user sentiment and satisfaction, I conducted sentiment analysis on user reviews, providing invaluable feedback for refining service quality and addressing user concerns.

Finally, I synthesized all findings into an executive summary and presentation, distilling key insights and recommendations for stakeholders. Throughout the project, my focus remained on translating data-driven insights into actionable strategies to drive Metrocar's success.
